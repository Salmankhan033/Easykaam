We live in an era where everything is just one-click away. Mobile application is making life easier.

In most of the situations, daily life services (Electrician, Plumber, Carpenter, Painter,          labour etc.) are difficult to find now a days. With the help of “EasyKaam” Android App we provide these services to a large variety of users searching for these services. It will empower the users to book services anytime anywhere in a specific location using this application. 

When you use this app, you’ll be connected with a pool of local handyman professionals who can take care of this work for you. In addition to freeing up your time for the more important things in life.

The inspiration behind this project (EasyKaam) is that, it’s too much difficult to find a professional technician. One aspect is that to find these handymen through word of mouth or through querying from a hardware store nearby. The obvious problem with this is that most of these handymen lacked professionalism, and / or skills. Furthermore they are often unavailable or not reliable, or simply charge much higher than what is considered reasonable. It’s clear that there is a need for a professional handyman services app and we jumped at the idea!
